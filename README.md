# World Map Website
This is a sample web page I made for my Software Engineering degree. It features API usage and understanding of Angular and TypeScript. By clicking on any of the countries on the world map, the box on the right will be filled with information about that country.

The webpage can be viewed and interacted with by opening a terminal in the d280-pa-wold-map-project directory and entering "npm install" then "ng serve". Navigate to http://localhost:4200/
